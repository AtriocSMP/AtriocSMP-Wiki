Right clicking on a waystone icon will hide it from your main menu, clicking the torch in the top left will turn on or off showing your hidden waystones. Right click a hidden waystone icon again to bring it back to the main gui.

Clicking the spyglass in the bottom middle will bring up a search option just type the name of the waystone you are looking for into the sign and it will bring it up
